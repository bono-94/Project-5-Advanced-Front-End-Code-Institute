## Most reused components:

- PostsPage:
  - Home, Feed, Liked
- Post:
  - PostsPage
- Profile:
  - PopularProfiles, PopularProfiles (mobile)
- DropdownMenus:
  - Post, ProfilePage, Comment
- InfiniteScrollComponent:
  - PostPage (loading Comment components)
  - PostsPage (loading all, feed or liked Post components)
  - ProfilePage (loading Post components that belong to the profile)

## Deployment steps

- add prebuild script
- add Procfile
- remove all console.logs
- use Bootstrap default imports to minimize the build
- deploy to Heroku

## Tests:

### Automated:

- used the msw library to mock user and logout endpoints
- tested the NavBar component:
  - renders without a problem
  - renders the link to a user profile for a logged in user
  - renders the sign in and sign up buttons again on logout

### Manual:

- every other feature tested extensively

## Libraries, contexts and hooks:

- react-infinite-scroll-component
  - introduced to replace traditional pagination with lazy loading instead of pagination to make the application more performant and seem more snappy/ engaging
- react-bootstrap:
  - introduced
- contexts:
  - CurrentUserContext exposes the user state to the entire app. Relevant components can subscribe to its changes
  - ProfileDataContext exposes the profile state to the entire app. Enables the PopularProfiles component to be in sync with the ProfilePage contents
- custom hooks written to reduce repeatable state logic:
  - useClickOutsideToggle: enable toggle on the burger menu
  - useRedirect: enable redirect for users who are either logged in or logged out, depending on the use case

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
